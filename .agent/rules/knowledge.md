# Merit System Architecture

## Overview

The Merit System is a core gamification feature that rewards students for attending events. It is fully integrated between the backend database and the frontend Profile UI.

## Data Flow

1.  **Event Definition**: Each `Event` document has a `merit_points` field.
2.  **Attendance Trigger**: When a student scans their QR Code at an event, the `registrationController.checkIn` function executes.
3.  **Database Update**: The backend adds `event.merit_points` to the `User`'s `current_merit` field using `$inc`.
4.  **Frontend Binding**: `Profile.jsx` fetches the user data and maps `userData.current_merit` to the `xp` prop of the gamification component.
5.  **Visualization**: `RankAscension.jsx` takes the raw XP value and calculates the current Rank (Cadet, Scout, etc.) and progress percentage towards the next rank.

## Key Constraints

- **High Performer**: (Revenue > Mean) && (Rating >= 4.0).
- **Quality Issue**: (Revenue > Mean) && (Rating < 3.5).
- **Community Builder**: (Attendance > Mean) && (Ticket Price < Median).
- **Needs Attention**: (Attendance < Mean) && (Revenue < Mean).

### B. Strategic Insight Logic

- **Revenue Concentration**: Analyzes Gini-coefficient style distribution of revenue across categories to identify growth dependency.
- **Sentiment Thresholding**: Triggers warnings if sentiment scores drop below **70%** despite high engagement, signifying technical or operational friction.
- **Audience Demand Matching**: Correlates high sentiment (**>90%**) with low frequency to recommend expansion in high-potential niches.

## 2. Digital Pass Architecture (Student Experience)

The "Digital Pass Wallet" transitions the system from simple booking lists to a high-fidelity credential system.

- **Visual Psychological Cues**: Uses perforation effects and high-contrast typography to increase perceived value and professionalism.
- **Data Densification**: Groups fragmented event data (Venue, Time, Category, Merit) into a single scan-ready component (QR-based check-in).

## 3. Financial Stewardship (Organizer Tools)

The Finance module implements real-time GAAP-adjacent tracking for independent organizers.

- **KPI Trend Analysis**: Uses Month-over-Month (MoM) growth calculations to provide organizers with immediate feedback on marketing campaign efficacy.
- **Revenue-by-Category Visualizations**: Implements a percentage-share breakdown to allow organizers to see their "Portfolio" of events at a glance.

## 4. Audit Trail & Transparency (Security)

The system maintains a comprehensive audit log utilizing an event-sourcing lite approach.

- **Immutable Action Logging**: Every critical action (Created, Updated, Checked-in) is stamped with User, Time, and a data snapshot.
- **Snapshot Viewer**: Allows administrators to compare the state of an event before and after critical changes for accountability.

## 5. Interactive Roadmap & Collective Tasking

The dashboard implements a real-time coordination layer for event staff.

- **Dynamic Run-of-Show (RoS)**: Organizers can build an event timeline on the fly. The system handles partial array updates via specialized PUT endpoints to ensure high performance and low data collision.
- **Task Synchronization**: A "shared-state" to-do list allows organizers to track operational readiness (e.g., AV checks, catering). The UI uses optimistic updates and toggles to provide a seamless management experience.
- **Management Heuristics**: The "Three-Dot" management menu on the schedule uses destructive action protection (confirmation dialogs) to prevent accidental data loss during high-pressure event execution.

## 6. Collaborative Permission Model (Security & Delegation)

The system implements a tiered authorization structure to balance security with operational efficiency.

- **Identity-Based Ownership**: Events are strictly tied to a `organizer_id`. General users and even other "Approved Organizers" are restricted from modifying events they do not own to maintain data integrity.
- **Community Leadership Permissions**: For events hosted by a specific club or organization, a **Community-Led Association Model** is applied. Authorized leaders (President, AJK, Committee, Secretary, Treasurer) are granted full **CRUD/Edit** access to community events.
- **Team Collaboration Model (Member/AJK/President)**: The system implements a shared-management approach for community events. All **Approved** members of a community (regardless of role tier) are granted **Edit** permissions on events hosted by their club. This allows collaborative efforts in managing schedules, tasks, and historical logs.
- **Dynamic Permission UI (canEdit Flag)**: The backend dynamically injects a `canEdit` boolean flag into event responses based on membership status: (Admin OR System Organizer OR Owner OR Approved Community Member). This flag controls the visibility of all management interfaces.
- **Unified Activity Log Access**: Access to "View All History" is granted to anyone with `canEdit` permissions, ensuring that the entire event team has visibility into the audit trail while restricting it for visitors.
- **Administrative Override**: Global Admins retain full CRUD capabilities across all events for mediation and oversight purposes.

## 7. Robust Data Ingestion & Sanitization (Stability)

The system implements strict defensive coding patterns to ensure state persistence across heterogeneous device environments.

- **Dynamic Type Parsing**: The frontend `EditEvent` flow performs explicit type casting (e.g., `parseInt(capacity) || 0`) for all numeric fields. This prevents "Cast Error" 400 Bad Request failures caused by `NaN` or empty strings reaching the MongoDB layer.
- **Reference Integrity**: Reference IDs (e.g., `venue_id`, `community_id`) are conditionally stripped of "placeholder" values (like "other") before submission, maintaining referential integrity in the database.
- **Cross-Component Prop Propagation**: The system uses a "Destructured Prop Safety" pattern in dashboard widgets (`InsightsPanel`, `EventTimeline`) to ensure that critical authorization flags like `canEdit` are consistently scoped, preventing ReferenceErrors during fragmented component updates.
- **Responsive Container Constraints**: Recharts components are wrapped in `ResponsiveContainer` units with explicit `min-height` and `min-width` fallback styles to prevent rendering failures and console warnings during initial layout calculations.

## 8. Organizer/Club Creation Ecosystem (Onboarding & Automation)

The system implements a seamless "Student-to-Leader" transition flow, automating the technical overhead of organization management.

- **Integrated Proposal Pipeline**: Students initiate organizer requests through a structured **Club Proposal** system. This captures legal and operational metadata (Mission, Advisor, Faculty) at the point of entry, ensuring all required organizational data is ready for platform instantiation.
- **Atomic Approval-to-Activation Logic**: The Admin approval process triggers an atomic backend operation that simultaneously:
  1. Promotes the user to the `organizer` role.
  2. Instantiates a new **Community** record based on proposal metadata.
  3. Assigns the user as the permanent **Owner/President** and first member of that community.
  4. Marks the proposal as officially **Approved** for audit purposes.
- **Metadata-Driven UI Hydration**: The Admin moderation interface (`OrganizerApprovals`) uses a **Populated Review Pattern**, dynamically fetching associated proposal documents only when needed. This ensures high performance for long approval queues while providing deep contextual data for moderation decisions.
- **Multi-Role Session Sync**: The system implements an **Optimistic Role Refresh** strategy. Upon login or profile sync, the backend computes the user's effective permissions based on their primary `role` and their `roles` array, ensuring that newly approved organizers gain immediate access to the "Organizer Suite" without requiring a re-login.

## 9. Venue Real-time Intelligence (Live Vibe Architecture)

The system implements a real-time status and density visualization layer to enhance campus navigation for students.

### A. Live Pulse Algorithm

The `getLiveVenueStatus` engine transitions venues from static "Office Hours" views to dynamic reactive states:

- **Event-Driven Occupancy**: Computes live status by cross-referencing Malaysian time against a venue's approved event schedule.
- **Dynamic Capacity Tracking**: Calculates real-time occupancy percentages (`(attendees / capacity) * 100`) to provide "Live Vibe" signals (e.g., "Full House", "Vibing", "Chilled").
- **Sequential Timer Logic**: Automatically switches between an "Ends in" timer for active events and a "Next Event in" countdown for transition periods.

### B. Venue Pulse Heatmap

The Heatmap component provides a visual "Registry" of a venue's daily availability.

- **Hourly Density Mapping**: Discretizes the venue's access hours into blocks, highlighting booked slots based on event start/end times.
- **Visual Psychological Signalling**: Uses color-coded glows (Fuchsia for Booked, Low-opacity for Free) to help students identify low-density study windows at a glance.
- **Client-Side Optimization**: Centralizes event fetching in the parent list component (`Venues.jsx`) to associate event data with venues in a single pass, preventing N+1 API overhead.

## 10. Temporal Event State Management (Stability & Correctness)

The system implements a robust temporal logic for event status to ensure UI consistency and accurate reporting.

- **Outcome-Based Status Determination**: Transitions from a simple "Start-Time" check to a more accurate `end_time` logic. Events are only considered "Past" or "Completed" after their full duration has elapsed.
- **Fallback Heuristics**: In cases where `end_time` is not explicitly defined, the system falls back to `date_time` (start time) to ensure no breakage.
- **Cross-Layer Synchronization**: This temporal logic is synchronized across the Backend (Filtering API, Analytics Engine) and Frontend (Status Badges, Roadmap Displays) to prevent cognitive dissonance for users (e.g., an event appearing as "Completed" while it is still happening).
- Points are awarded **only upon Check-In** (attendance), not just registration.
- Points are cumulative and persistent in the `User` model.
- The Rank System is purely visual and derived from the `current_merit` total.

## 11. Administrative User Intelligence (Governance)

The User Management dashboard provides a real-time governance layer for platform administrators.

- **Real-time KPI Hydration**: The `getAllUsers` API implements an "Aggregation-on-Fetch" pattern, returning global counts for all user roles (Total, Student, Organizer, Admin) in a single request. This ensures that KPI cards are always accurate without requiring separate high-overhead polling.
- **Portable Data Registry (PDF Export)**: Implements a client-side document generation engine using `jsPDF`. The system maps the current user state into a professional tabular layout with automatic styling and temporal stamping (`UniVerse_Users_List_YYYY-MM-DD.pdf`).
- **Forensic Access Termination**: Provides a "Terminate Access" (Delete) operation protected by internal safeguards (preventing self-deletion and strictly auditing all termination events).

## 12. Global Analytics Filtering (Operational Intelligence)

The Admin Dashboard implements a unified, period-aware filtering system to provide deep temporal insights into platform performance.

- **Synchronized Range Logic**: A global `range` parameter (`week`, `month`, `year`) is propagated from the frontend state to all backend statistics queries. This ensures that every metric (KPIs, Charts, Top Events) reflects the exact same window of time, providing a consistent "Snapshot" of performance.
- **Dynamic Data Aggregation**:
  - **Granularity Adaption**: The "Platform Activity" and "Daily Traffic" charts dynamically adjust their data grouping. When a weekly/monthly range is selected, data is grouped by `day`; when a yearly range is selected, it is grouped by `month`. This prevents data overcrowding in the UI.
  - **Current vs. Previous Period Comparison**: The backend calculates metrics for both the **Active Range** and the **Immediate Previous Period** (e.g., current 7 days vs initial 7 days). This enables the display of real-time growth/decline percentages (e.g., `+15.2%`) across all KPIs.
- **Contextual KPI Branding**: The frontend dynamically re-labels KPI cards based on the filter context. "Total Events" (Yearly view) automatically becomes "New Events" (Weekly/Monthly view), and descriptions shift from "Lifetime Volume" to period-specific context like "Joined this week".
- **Performance Optimized Filtering**: Date-based filtering is implemented at the database layer using MongoDB `$match` and `$gte` operators during aggregation, ensuring large data sets are narrowed down efficiently before calculations occur.

## 13. Infrastructure & Deployment Standards (Frontend)

- **Relative API Routing**: The frontend uses relative paths (`/api/...`) rather than hardcoded URLs (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`). This ensures the application works seamlessly with the Vite development proxy and in production environments.
- **Icon Set Standardization**: Lucide-React is the primary icon provider. When introducing new loading states or visual metaphors, the system mandates the use of standardized components like `Loader2` (with `animate-spin`) to maintain UI consistency.

## 14. Responsive Admin Interface (UX/UI)

The Admin section uses a mobile-first responsive design to ensure accessibility across devices.

- **Hamburger Navigation**: Implemented a sliding sidebar menu controlled by a stateful hamburger button in the global header. The menu utilizes `Framer Motion` for smooth transitions and an overlay backdrop for better focus.
- **Contextual Closing**: The mobile navigation automatically closes upon selecting a route or clicking the backdrop, reducing manual overhead for the administrator.
- **Dynamic Styling (CN Utility)**: Standardized on the `cn` (class-name) utility for managing complex tailwind classes, especially for responsive states like `translate-x` and `w` (width).

## 15. Operational Navigation Context (Admin Dashboard)

To improve administrative throughput, the dashboard implements "Shortcut Logic" within its KPI cards.

- **Direct Approval Links**: High-priority cards like "Pending Approvals" are interactive. Clicking them provides a direct bypass to the specific management module (`/admin/events/approvals`), allowing admins to move from high-level statistics to operational actions in a single click.
- **Visual Psychological Cues**: Interactive cards use `cursor-pointer` and hover border effects (`hover:border-violet-500/30`) to signal navigability without cluttering the UI with additional buttons.
